## üìù About The Project

**Crudify** was born from the need to speed up the development of web applications that rely on many CRUD operations. Instead of rewriting the same repetitive code, this project provides a solid foundation and tools to generate complete modules (models, controllers, migrations, and views/components) with just a few commands.
